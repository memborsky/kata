# Program Kata's

This repository contains program Kata's that can be used for learning a new language or honing your skills with a language you already know.

### Structure

The repository is broken down using the first 3 digits as a suggested path for completing each Kata in order. This is not the path that you must take, it is merely a suggestion for learning.

### Input / Output

The input files will list all of the individual lines of input. If more than one line is presented, it means that the line would be carriage returned or go for the next point of entry in the program.

The output shows the textual output in series with input being shown from the input.txt with a prefix of > on the line. This is to denote where each field of the input aligns with the output for the given example(s).
