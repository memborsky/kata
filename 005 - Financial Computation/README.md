# Financial Computation

## Background

New Galaxy has a simple taxation system. Income under 12,500 pixel dust (the basic unit of currency) is taxed at 32 percent, and anything greater or equal to 12,500 pixel dust is taxed at 65 percent.

## Exercise

Write a program that reads incomes and prints the taxes due. The program should loop until the user sends an 'exit' string. Assuming the incoming is an integer, dropping fractional parts of the tax so that it is written as a integer.
